## Issue-Driven Development

We follow an **Issue-Driven Development** process. This means:
-   **No code without an Issue.** Every Pull Request must be linked to an open Issue.
-   **Discuss first.** If you have a major idea, open an Issue or start a Discussion before writing code.

## Pull Request Guidelines

-   **Title**: Use a clear title (e.g., `Add Veo 3 video integration`).
-   **Description**: Explain *what* changed and *why*.
-   **Screenshots**: If you changed the UI, please include screenshots or a video.
-   **Tests**: Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.
